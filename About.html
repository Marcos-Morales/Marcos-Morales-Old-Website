        <p>Welcome! If you're currently reading this, then that means you probably want to know a little bit more about me.</p>
        <p>First things first, my name is Marcos Morales. I'm currently 21 years old and my expected graduation date from the University of Oklahoma is May 2020.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: I actually created this website as an MIS 3033 project, however, it is also a great showcase of my personal info, neccessary employment skills, and past projects I've worked on.</p>
